# Codance - Neuromorphic Resonance Platform

## Overview

Codance is the technical implementation of the Neuromorphic Resonance project, a revolutionary dance-driven AI ecosystem that creates a symbiotic relationship between dancers, music, and artificial intelligence at massive scale. This immersive experience combines movement tracking, biometric data, adaptive sound generation, and visual elements to create a truly unique and interactive dance environment.

## Key Components

1. **Kinetic Field Mapping System** - Tracks movement patterns of dancers
2. **Bio-Signal Integration** - Captures biometric data from wearable devices
3. **Neuromorphic Sound Engine** - Generates experimental music based on crowd movements
4. **Collective Memory Engine** - Integrates pre-selected songs into the AI-generated soundscape
5. **Distributed Haptic Feedback** - Delivers haptic feedback through the dance floor
6. **Holographic Resonance Visualization** - Creates visual displays based on music and movements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
